[feed reader testing]()_
## what did I test ??
I tested some important features of my RSS fead reader ,I made 3 test suits each suit has some tests **:-**
* This is my first test - it tests to make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not
empty.
* A test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
* A test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. 
* A test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
* A test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
* A test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
